## Usage

The weather dashboard is designed to display current and future (5 days) weather conditions for a city including temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The dashboard also uses a colour coding system for the UV index to enable users to quickly understand whether the conditions are favourable, moderate or severe. Previous search are automatically added to the search history to facilitate the user experience. 

When searching for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history:
